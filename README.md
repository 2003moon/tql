Query Model:
each query  consists of 4 parts. They are:
1.Declaring variables:  Two different kinds of variables can be declared
  ○ Sensor collection
  ○ Observation collection
2. Generate sensor collections:  Assign the variables with sensor collections. Sensor collections are generated by writing a select query on top of  Sensor  (system defined sensor collection)   or those sensor collection variables which are already assigned values.
3. Generate observation collections:  Given a sensor collection generated above, an observation collection is created, consisting of all the observations generated by each sensor in the sensor collection
4. Final query:  one final query is written on top of the observation collections generated above. The result of this query is final output to the user.

Query example of TQL:
# declaring variables of sensor collection type
   DEFINE SensorCollection​ sensor_collection1, sensor_collection2
# declaring variables of observation collection type
   DEFINE ObservationCollection ​observation_collection1, observation_collection2
# generating sensor collection
// NOTE: there will be no subqueries, group by or aggregation function in this type of queries
  sensor_collection1 =
  SELECT *
  FROM Sensor, Infrastructure
  WHERE Sensor.Location IN​ Infrastructure.locations AND​ Infrastructure.floor=2
// NOTE: collection variables which are already assigned can be used in the FROM clause of subsequent queries
  sensor_collection2 =
  SELECT *
  FROM sensor_collection1 sen,
  WHERE sen.Type.name = “WiFi AP”
  
Usage of translator:
Run Main.java. You need have your own files similart to our "example.csv" files containing a TQL query or you can use our example files to try our translator.
